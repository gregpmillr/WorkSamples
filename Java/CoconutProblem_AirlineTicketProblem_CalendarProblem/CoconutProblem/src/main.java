 * <p>
 * When run this program will:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Tests all methods in Island class
 * <li>Determine the minimum number of coconuts for a given amount of sailors
 * <li>Determine the maximum amount of sailors that can satisfy the problem
 * <li>Tests that a given number of coconuts is resolvable to sailors
